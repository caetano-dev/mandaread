# Mandaread - Mandarin Reading Program

Mandaread is a web application designed to help users improve their Mandarin reading skills. It allows importing Mandarin texts (provided via a modal input with pipe-separated values including Hanzi, Pinyin, and English translation), displays them with Pinyin above each character, and shows translations for words not yet marked as "known" by the user.

## Features

*   **Text Input:** Allows importing Mandarin text via a modal on the homepage. Users can either:
    *   Manually input the title and provide the Mandarin (Hanzi), Pinyin, and English translation for each word/phrase, separated by pipe characters (`|`)
    *   Use AI-powered text generation to create stories automatically by selecting a theme and length
*   **Standalone Flashcard Creation:** Dedicated section on the homepage to generate Chinese flashcards on any topic without needing to import texts first
*   **Homepage:**
    *   Displays a list of all imported texts.
    *   Shows a preview of the first 15 words of each text.
    *   Allows users to select a text to read.
    *   Allows users to delete imported texts.
    *   Provides a button to import new texts via the modal input.
*   **Reading Interface:**
    *   Displays the full Mandarin text.
    *   Shows Pinyin transcription above each Hanzi character.
    *   Displays the English translation below words that are *not* in the user's known vocabulary list.
    *   Allows users to click on any Hanzi word to mark it as "known", instantly hiding its translation and adding it to the persistent vocabulary list.
    *   Words are displayed inline, flowing like a standard text.
    *   **Flashcard Export:** Export unknown words as CSV with AI-generated example phrases for flashcard creation.
*   **Settings Page:**
    *   Allows users to import and export their known vocabulary list as a JSON file.
    *   Provides a slider to adjust the base font size for the reading interface.
    *   Displays the list of known words with an option to delete individual words.
*   **AI Features:**
    *   **Story Generation:** Create Chinese stories with proper formatting using AI (via Puter.js)
    *   **Phrase Generation:** Generate contextual example phrases for unknown words during flashcard export
    *   **Standalone Flashcard Creation:** Generate themed flashcard sets (5-25 cards) directly from the homepage
    *   **No Setup Required:** Free AI access without API keys or backend setup
*   **Persistent Storage:**
    *   Uses IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) in the browser to store:
        *   Imported texts.
        *   The user's known vocabulary list.
        *   User settings (like font size).
    *   All data persists across browser sessions.
*   **Styling:** Uses CSS Modules for component-scoped styling.
*   **UUID:** `uuid` library for generating unique text IDs.

## JSON Input Format

**Note:** Text import no longer uses JSON files directly. Instead, use the "Import New Text" button on the homepage, which provides fields to paste Mandarin, Pinyin, and English text, separating each word/phrase with a pipe character (`|`).

**Example of pipe-separated input:**

*   **Title:** My Lesson
*   **Mandarin:** Êàë|ÂñúÊ¨¢|ËãπÊûú
*   **Pinyin:** w«í|x«êhuan|p√≠nggu«í
*   **English:** I|like|apple

## Vocabulary JSON Format

When exporting or importing vocabulary, the JSON file should contain an array of word objects, where each object has `hanzi`, `pinyin`, and `translation` properties.

**Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "hanzi": "Êàë",
    "pinyin": "w«í",
    "translation": "I"
  },
  {
    "hanzi": "ÂñúÊ¨¢",
    "pinyin": "x«êhuan",
    "translation": "like"
  }
]
```
